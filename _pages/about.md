I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at UC San Diego Psychology and work with Prof. Timothy Gentner in the Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory. My research aims at expanding my PhD work on understanding how predictive coding is implemented in songbird auditory neurons and how complex behaviors such as birdsong recognition can be explained using the predictive coding framework. More broadly, I am interested in computational modeling to explain perceptual inference of natural signals, especially temporally patterned signals such as speech and audio, and how these inferences are relevant to behavior. 
Before this, I graduated from IIT Madras with a BTech & MTech in Biotechnology. For my Masters thesis, I worked with Prof. Devarajan Karunagaran on role of microRNAs in breast cancer.
