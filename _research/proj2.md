Decoding complex behaviors such as vocal recognition with predictive coding

Comprehension of vocal communication signals in both songbirds and humans is intricately tied to anticipations rooted in prior sensory knowledge. To elucidate the underlying perceptual and cognitive processes, the theoretical framework of predictive coding proves invaluable. Beyond elucidating general perception, this framework extends its explanatory power to complex behavioral phenomena, including the intricate process of recognizing vocal sequences. An intriguing question arises: is the internal model adaptable based on complex behavior?  The neural and cognitive mechanisms underlying this are not well understood. Employing innovative methods for analyzing both the acoustic and temporal dimensions of vocal signals, we subsequently embark on a dual approach—examining the behavioral and physiological dimensions—to unravel the foundations of the predictive structure inherent in birdsong.

In our experimental paradigm, songbirds underwent training in a song recognition decision-making task, presented with entire song repertoires. Notably, our findings indicate that songbirds exhibit proficient performance in recognizing random segments of birdsong, suggesting that they learned the underlying song model of the trained repertoires. Furthermore, they recognize song segments even when the temporal structure of the song is disrupted, underscoring the resilience of their learned song models to temporal alterations. Using the same behavioral framework, we then recorded from populations of sensory neurons while birds were making perceptual decisions to understand whether and to elucidate in which ways complex behaviors bias this internal model for perception in songbirds. We are studying if vocal recognition can by explained by predictive coding when the generative model matches the stimulus in the world? We hypothesize can explain vocal recognition as when the song model matches the exterior signal or equivalent to when the prediction error goes to zero.
